## Important Notice Regarding False Virus Detection

Please note: Due to the nature of the application, Windows Defender or other antivirus software may sometimes flag the IsUp binary as a potential threat. This is a false positive, and we assure you that the software is safe to use.

To resolve this, you may need to:

- Manually whitelist the IsUp executable in your antivirus settings.
- Temporarily disable Windows Defender or your antivirus software while installing or running the application.

We are actively working on minimizing such detections but wanted to provide transparency on this matter. If you have concerns, please feel free to reach out for assistance.
